:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Provide information on next steps locally
- Reflect & Review
- Answer final questions
- Collect Feedback

## This lesson is open source

You can help us improve this over time! Issues are valuabe too, not only PRs. 


## Local Resources

:::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Gather local resources in links in advance

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Most universities core open research practices are concentrated in two places:
- libraries (sometimes with an emphasis on no-paywall rather than open source)
- research computing (sometimes with an emphasis on scientific computing)





## Closing 

::::::::: challenge

### Reflection
On paper, or your favorite drawing tool, visualize what we have learned.

### Call to Action

Consider how you can maximize the time you spent learning in this workshop. 
It's okay to dream big, but momentum builds from small wins, so we challenge you to think of at least one small thing that you are very confident you can do. 

Some ideas: 
- Set one realistic goal of how you will use what you learned in your scholarship or teaching in the next two weeks, set yourself a reminder (or calendar invite)
- Send an email/ schedule a meeting with one person you met who you want to stay in touch with
- Set aside some time to review one particular point or explore one new idea you have based on the workshop

### One up, One down


Provide one up, one down feedback on the entire workshop. Rules:

- Say only one thing, and try not to duplicate. This gets harder for those who come later!
- Instructors will try not to respond, only record responses (e.g. in the Etherpad). This is also hard, but important!

This exercise should take about 15 minutes.
