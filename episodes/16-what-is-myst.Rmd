## Introduction

MyST is an open-source, community-driven project to improve scientific communication, including integrations into Jupyter Notebooks and computational results. (Sourced from [mystmd.org's Project goals](https://mystmd.org/guide#project-goals))

Myst is a tool that we will learn to use to build interactive webpages or pdfs. The benifit of this is more powerful publishing of content and information.
Here's an example of a paper published using myst: [A Literature Review On AI fairness Best Practices](https://ml4sts.com/fairml-bestpractices/)

Let's learn about using myst on the simple repo we created on the first day.

## Starting myst
Open your terminal and `cd` into your repo's directory.

In your terminal type myst:
```bash
myst
```
```
Welcome to the MyST CLI! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

myst init walks you through creating a myst.yml file.

You can use MyST to:

 - create interactive websites from markdown and Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ“ˆ
 - build & export professional PDFs and Word documents ðŸ“„

This tells you that all the files that were in your directory (README.md & index.md) were built into a website locally.

To view this website follow the link provided in the prompt:
`http://localhost:3000`

If your port `3000` was already occupied you might get a different number

### What dit this do?
Firstly we notice that the files in the directory got increaced by 1. The new file is called myst.yml as mentioned by the output from the command we ran.

If we opened the webpage using the link above we see somthing like this

![](fig\myst_page.png)
![](fig\myst_page2.png)

We notice a few things on this page:
* On the top-left corner says `Made with Myst`
* For each md file we have a button on the left page section 
* On the top-right corner we have a dark/light theme button as well as a search bar that works!

#### What does that tell us?
We were able to create an interactive webpage using the same markdown files and turn them into an interactive page. We used the `myst` tool to make the webpage look nicer and have more powers.

#### What did myst need to run?
We noticed earlier that myst added a file to our directory as soon as we ran it. `myst.md`
Let's figure out why it did so by viewing the contents of it and trying to understand it.

```yaml
# See docs at: https://mystmd.org/guide/frontmatter
version: 1
project:
  id: 5f256b79-5f82-4a71-b061-138da64f191a
  # title:
  # description:
  # keywords: []
  # authors: []
  github: https://github.com/mystudyroom0/my-website
  # To autogenerate a Table of Contents, run "myst init --write-toc"
site:
  template: book-theme
  # options:
  #   favicon: favicon.ico
  #   logo: site_logo.png
  ```


We find that the the file holds some metadata for the webpage. Most of it isn't filled in and is also commented out since it isn't filled out yet. (we comment lines in the YAML syntax using the `#` symbol). We also some site settings such as the theme, logo and icon.
So we learn that myst requires this file to be in your project directory to be able to built the webpage.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Myst is a tool that builds interactive webpages from markdown files 
- To built a webpage using myst we simply start myst on the terminal
- Myst requires the file `myst.md` to run and build a webpage
