## Introduction

MyST is an open-source, community-driven project to improve scientific communication, including integrations into Jupyter Notebooks and computational results. (Sourced from [mystmd.org's Project goals](https://mystmd.org/guide#project-goals))

Myst is a tool that we will learn to use to build interactive webpages or pdfs. The benifit of this is more powerful publishing of content and information.
Here's an example of a paper published using myst: [A Literature Review On AI fairness Best Practices](https://ml4sts.com/fairml-bestpractices/)

Let's learn about using myst on the simple repo we created on the first day.

## Starting myst
Open your terminal and `cd` into your repo's directory.

In your terminal type myst:
```bash
myst
```
```
Welcome to the MyST CLI! ðŸŽ‰ ðŸš€

myst init walks you through creating a myst.yml file.

You can use MyST to:

 - create interactive websites from markdown and Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ“ˆ
 - build & export professional PDFs and Word documents ðŸ“„

This tells you that all the files that were in your directory (README.md & index.md) were built into a website locally.

To view this website follow the link provided in the prompt:
`http://localhost:3000`

### What dit this do?
Firstly we notice that the files in the directory got increaced by 1. The new file is called myst.yml as mentioned by the output from the command we ran.

If we opened the webpage using the link above we see somthing like this

![](fig\myst_page.png)
![](fig\myst_page2.png)

We notice a few things on this page:
- On the top-left corner says `Made with Myst`
- For each md file we have a button on the left page section 
- On the top-right corner we have a dark/light theme button as well as a search bar
